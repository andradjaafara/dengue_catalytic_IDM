# dengue_catalytic_IDM
Accompanying repository for dengue catalytic model poster presented at IDM Conference 2024.

We updated and developed catalytic model of dengue for fitting to age-stratified case-notifications data.

1. codes/case_age_catalytic_simulations.R contains code to run some simulation analysis to see comparing Poisson and multinomial fitting based on multiple current and historical transmission scenarios.

2. codes/case_age_catalytic_jakarta.R contains code to run analysis which uses a hierarchical model for catalytic model shown in the poster presented at the IDM Conference 2024.
